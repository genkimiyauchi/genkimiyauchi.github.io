I gave an oral and poster presentation on our latest works related to the [OpenSwarm](https://openswarm.eu/) project at the [1st German Robotics Conference (GRC)](https://robotics-institute-germany.de/event/first-german-robotics-conference/).

Myself and students from the Resilient Cyber Physical Systems group (led by Prof. Roderich Gro√ü) in TU Darmstadt also showcased robot demonstrations throughout the conference.
