I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Sheffield, working on swarm robotics and human-swarm interaction.
In particular, I am working on the [OpenSwarm](https://openswarm.eu/) project funded by Horizon Europe / Innovate UK, where I focus on developing energy-aware robot swarms.

Prior to this, I obtained my PhD in Automatic Control and Systems Engineering with the Natural Robotics Lab under the supervision of Professor [Roderich Groß](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/rcps/rcps_menu/team_menu_rcps/team_details_135744.en.jsp) at [ACSE](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse) and [Sheffield Robotics](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/sheffieldrobotics) at the University of Sheffield.
My research explored how multiple human users can dynamically share the control of a swarm of robots.
My research interests include swarm robotics, multi-robot systems, human-robot interaction and energy-aware systems.
