  abstract     = {Simultaneously controlling multiple robot swarms is challenging for a single human operator. When involving multiple operators, however, they can each focus on controlling a specific robot swarm, which helps distribute the cognitive workload. They could also exchange some robots with each other in response to the requirements of the tasks they discover. This paper investigates the ability of multiple operators to dynamically share the control of robot swarms and the effects of different communication types on performance and human factors. A total of 52 participants completed an experiment in which they were randomly paired to form a team. In a 2×2 mixed factorial study, participants were split into two groups by communication type (direct vs. indirect). Both groups experienced different robot-sharing conditions (robot-sharing vs. no-robot-sharing). Results show that although the ability to share robots did not necessarily increase task scores, it allowed the operators to switch between working independently and collaboratively, reduced the total energy consumed by the swarm, and was considered useful by the participants.},

  abstract    = {We investigate how reliable movement can emerge in aggregates of highly error-prone individuals. The individuals—robotic modules—move stochastically using vibration motors. By coupling them via elastic links, soft-bodied aggregates can be created. We present distributed algorithms that enable the aggregates to move and deform reliably. The concept and algorithms are validated through formal analysis of the elastic couplings and experiments with aggregates comprising up to 49 physical modules—among the biggest soft-bodied aggregates to date made of autonomous modules. The experiments show that aggregates with elastic couplings can shrink and stretch their bodies, move with a precision that increases with the number of modules, and outperform aggregates with no, or rigid, couplings. Our findings demonstrate that mechanical couplings can play a vital role in reaching coherent motion among individuals with exceedingly limited and error-prone abilities, and may pave the way for low-power, stretchable robots for high-resolution monitoring and manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Involving human operators to support swarms of robots can be beneficial to address increasingly complex scenarios. However, the shared control between multiple operators remains a challenge, especially where communication between the operators is not available. This paper studies the problem of forming a dynamic chain of robots connecting two operators moving within an environment. The robot chain enables operators to share information and robots among themselves. Based on supervisory control theory, we propose a distributed solution which formally guarantees that the deployed robot controllers match the modeled specifications. We validate the controllers through simulations with groups of up to 40 mobile robots in an environment with obstacles, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach.},
